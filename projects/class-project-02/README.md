# Class project 2: Extension

## Project description

**Topic** Select a prediction-related topic and "register" it with me (Ed).

- The topic should be related to something we talked about it class, but it cannot be something we directly covered. The idea is to extend our course topics to new applications/areas.
- You should have a motivation for why this topic is interesting/important.
- You should also have a good example of an application of this topic.
- **Still important** People cannot overlap in topics. First mover wins.

## Materials due

Your topic is due by the end of the day on **February 6th**.

By 11:59p on **March 11th**, submit **two documents** on Canvas (share links or upload files):

1. an HTML notebook of the Wiki explanation of your topic that includes the intuition, math, and example (including code)
1. slides for a five-minute presentation explaining the topic and showing your example 

**NOTE:** No late submissions.

## Some ideas for topics

You are not limited to these ideas, but here are some suggestions (some of the topics below are very broad; you might want to choose something more specific):

- Multi-level output (esp. ordered)
- Maximum likelihood estimation
- Discriminant analysis
- Bayesian machine learning methods
- Relaxing IID assumptions
	- Time-series prediction (esp. CV)
	- Spatial prediction (esp. CV)
- Image processing (e.g., facial recognition or satellite imagery)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Transfer learning (esp. [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/))
- Neural networks
- Convolutions
- Reinforcement learning
- Adversarial learning
- Unsupervised learning (esp. clustering algorithms)
- Semi-supervised learning
- Graphical methods
- Experiments
- Heterogeneous treatment effect estimation
- Extensions on standard "boosting"
