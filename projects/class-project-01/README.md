# Class project 1: Application

## Project description

**Topic** Select a prediction problem/context and "register" it with me (Ed).

Think big. What's something you want to try to predict?

- Make sure the topic is interesting/important (at least to you).
- Make sure data exist.
- Make sure there's a real chance that you can meaningfully complete a prediction-problem project on this topic during the time that you have.
- **Still important** People cannot overlap in topics/data. First mover wins.

## Materials due

Your topic is due by the end of the day on **January 30th**. Talk with us if you are struggling with ideas, data, _etc_.

By 11:59p on **March 4th**, submit **your final document** on Canvas (share link or upload file). This final document should be a notebook or blog-like document that contains

- well-documented code;
- all data-processing steps from the first load to the final prediction;
- aesthetically pleasing visualizations;
- a narrative walkthrough (not just code comments);
- appropriate measures of model performance.

The document should be something that you could send to a potential employer to advertise your skills.

**NOTE:** No late submissions.
